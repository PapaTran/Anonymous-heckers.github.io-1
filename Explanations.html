<h3>1. What equation should be used to verticaly move the line up 2 *graph 1*</h3>
<p>a: √(x)+2, when graphing radical equations all vertical movement is shown outside the radical. </p>
<p>b: √(x)-2, when the movement is outside the radical the units are not inverted</p>
<p>c: √(x+2), when the line needs to move verticaly the extra function is outside the radical</p>
<p>d: √(x-2), see explanation for C</p>
<h3>2. What is the equation that represents the line*graph 2* </h3>
<p>a: √(x+2)+5, this would move the line up five but LEFT 2</p>
<p>b: √(x-2)+5, this would move the line up 5 right 2</p>
<p>c: √(x+5)-2, this would move the line down 2 and left 5, instead of up 5 right 2</p>
<p>d: √(x-5)+2, this would move the line up 2 and right 5, instead of up 5 right 2</p>
<h3>3. Simplify √x^16*y^4/y^4</h3>
<p>a: 1, to get one all of the numerators and denominators must be the same</p>
<p>b: x^8, the square root of 16 is 4 and the square root of y^4 is y^2 and since they are dividing by itslef it is x^4 x 1 which is x^4</p>
<p>c: y^4, it should be x instead of y to the 4th</p>
<p>d: All of the above, not all of the answers are correct</p>
<h3>4. Simplify √(x^2+y^4+9) </h3>
<p>a: "x+y^2-3", when writing equations with exponents the varible with the highest exponent goes first, and the sqaure root of 9 is 3</p>
		<p>b: "y^2+x+3", the order of varibles is correct and the sqaure roots are correct</p>
		<p>c: "x^2+y-3", the varibles are swapped along with the sqare root of 9 is 3 </p>
		<p>d: "x^2+y+3", the varibles are swapped</p>
<h3>5. X-6 = √x Which is the extraneous solution?</h3>
<p>a: 4, after you solve, if you place 4 abck into the eqaution you get -2=2</p>
<p>b: 9, after you solve, if you place 9 into the original equation you get 3=3</p>
<p>c: Both, only one answer is extraneous solution</p>
<p>d: Neither, on of the is the actual solution</p>
<h3>6. √(x+7)-7=x Which is the solution?</h3>
<p>a: 7, when you place 7 back into the equation you do not get a equal equation</p>
<p>b: 6, see explanation for A</p>
<p>c: Both, neither of the solutions work in the equation</p>
<p>d: Neither, neither of the solutions work so both are extraneous you neither is correct</p>
